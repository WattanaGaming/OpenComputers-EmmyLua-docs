# OpenComputers doc files for EmmyLua and Sumneko's Lua language server
Because having to open the docs in web browser sucks(...?)â„¢

If you are wondering why some functions are missing, that's because they're only included in OpenOS.

## Contributing
If you found any  of these(or just want to improve the docs), feel free to submit an issue or make a PR:
1. OC functions that are only found in OpenOS
2. Undocumented functions
3. Wrong documentation
